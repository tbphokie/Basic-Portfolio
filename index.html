			I've been a C++ developer for over 20 years but due to a recent layoff, I am now embarking on expanding my knowledge from just C++ and C# to web development.  My time these days are spent split between job searching, learning the basics of web development, and taking care of my two dogs (not pictured above, but close enough, they all look alike).
			<p>
			My job consisted of supporting the engineering department (I didn't work for IT)  by providing tools that made the engineers life a little easier and keeping the data required by our coverage prediction tool as up to date as possible, i.e. without spending money.  While I miss it, I don't miss the stress levels due to always being concerned about being laid off and the having to do more with less philosophy  the company had.
			<p>
			My dogs are Sussex Spaniels, a rare breed that I now have two of.  If you want a quiet dog that doesn't slobber, don't get one of these.  They like to bark and howl, no they love to bark and howl.  Chaos is 4 and Daisy is 1.
